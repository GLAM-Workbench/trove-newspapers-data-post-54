However, some articles published after 1954 have been made available. This repository provides data about digitised newspapers in Trove that have articles available from after 1954 (the ‘copyright cliff of death’).</p> <p>The data was extracted from the Trove API using <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/Beyond_the_copyright_cliff_of_death/\">this notebook</a> from the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/\">Trove newspapers</a> section of the GLAM Workbench.</p> <p>The data is available as a CSV file entitled <code>newspapers_post_54.csv</code> and contains the following fields:</p> <ul> <li><code>title</code> – the full title of the newspaper</li> <li><code>state</code> – the state in which the newspaper was published</li> <li><code>id</code> – Trove’s unique identifier for this newspaper</li> <li><code>startDate</code> – the earliest date of articles from this newspaper available in Trove</li> <li><code>endDate</code> – the latest date of articles from this newspaper available in Trove</li> <li><code>issn</code> – ISSN</li> <li><code>number_of_articles</code> – the number of articles from this newspaper <strong>published after 1954</strong> available in Trove</li> <li><code>troveUrl</code> – link to more information about this newspaper</li> </ul> <hr /> <p>This repository is part of the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.github.io/\">GLAM Workbench</a>.<br /> If you think this project is worthwhile, you might like <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/wragge?o=esb\">to sponsor me on GitHub</a>.</p>"
